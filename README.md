# Shopify App Template

**This template is built from Scrutiny - a Shopify App that allows customers to document their experience with a product overtime.**

It is built with the following tech stack:
- NodeJs/ExpressJs with TypeScript


This is a backend template that gives the opportunity to hookup any frontend I like.

**For this app to work you need a .env file in the root folder filled with the following**

```
DB_URL= a database string
SHOP= example.myshopify.com
API_KEY= api key from admin dashboard
API_SECRET_KEY= api secret key from admin dashboard
SCOPES= write_customers
HOST= tunneling service url
```
